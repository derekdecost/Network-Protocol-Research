# Network_Protocol_Research

This repository contains source code generated while enrolled in the graduate section of Network Design and Protocols course at 
University of Massachusetts Lowell in 2022. This includes implementations of the RDT, Go-Back-N, Selective Repeat, and TCP
network protocols using UDP sockets, and implementing each protocols functionalities based on publicly available standards,
along with the procedures outlined in the required course textbook.

All code functions using local loopback mode, communicating using IP address 127.0.0.1, but may be changed to allow for 
communication between 2 networked devices. Data is tranferred from the "client_data" folder, to the "server_data" folder in each
protocol's containing folder.
